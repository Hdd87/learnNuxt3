# composables

1. when building front end applications , we often need to reuse logic for common tasks 

2. a composable is a function that leverages Vue's composition api to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic 

3. nuxt3 has a composables directory to automatically import your vue composables into your application using auto imports

Example : 
add a cart to that increases/decreases when a customer selects/deselects a phone 

Steps

1. create a `composables` folder 

2. create a states.js file inside this composables folder 

3. move the nav bar from the default into a dedicated component

4. auto import the navbar into the default layout using correctly named tag

5. add cart to navbar component

6. call the composable inside the states.js into the setup in the navbar component 

7. go to dynamic iphone page 
    - create a button called buy 
    - create a click event that calls a function addToCart()
    - call the composable useCart() from composables directory and assign to variable cart
    - when called via click function addToCart() a property called name into the cart array :
    - name comes from previously design dynamic route 
    - ```({name : `iphone-${route.params.name}`,})```
    - 

```notice

`export const useCart = () => useState(() => []);`

The provided code is exporting a custom hook named useCart. This hook is implemented using the useState hook from React.

The code creates a functional component that returns an array as its state. The initial state of the array is an empty array []. The useState hook takes an initial value as an argument and returns an array containing the current state value and a function to update the state.

By using an arrow function as the initial value in useState, it ensures that the initial state is only evaluated once, when the useCart hook is first called. This is known as a lazy initialization.

The exported useCart hook allows components to use the state management capabilities of React's useState hook, specifically for managing a shopping cart or any array-based state.
