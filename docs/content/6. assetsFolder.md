# Assets folder 

1. The assets folder is used to add all website assets that are used by the build tool (webpack or vite)
2. this directory contains :
    - stylesheets (css,sass,etc)
    - fonts
    -images that won't be served from the public directory

3. installing tailwindcss.com
    - go to https://tailwindcss.com
    - go to docs
    - under installation select Framework Guides
    - select nuxtjs
    - select nuxt3
    - 

4. Install tailwind css

5. first do not add the PostCSS config to your nuxt.config.js right now . do it later 

6. create the assets directory
    - create css directory
    - then create a file for the css 
        - we can it main.css
        - or tailwind.css
        - paste the 3  `@tailwind` directives which as base, components, and utilities

7. next add the Postcss to the nuxt.config.js

8. Configure your template paths

9. Add the CSS file globally in the nuxt.config.ts file so that nuxt knows where to find the css file:
    - css: ['~/assets/css/tailwind.css']
    - if not we have to import it into each layout one by one like below:

    code:
```vue
<script>
    import "~/assets/css/tailwind.css";
</script>
```

10. start the build process

11. basically do all the steps listed in 
tailwind website! and it works))
