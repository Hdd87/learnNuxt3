# Routing

1. nuxt provides a file based routing to create routes
2. uses the vue router under the hood 
3. nuxt has Pages directory which holds all page routes
4. nuxt goes to *app.vue __first__* before going to pages so we use the <Nuxtpage /> tag in app.vue to render any .vue components inside the pages 
5. created an index page and about page inside the pages directory
6. If I remove the app.vue it will show only pages inside the pages directory
