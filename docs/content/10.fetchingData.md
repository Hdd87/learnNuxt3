# Data Fetching 

1. when building applications we need to fetch data from an API Server 

2. Nuxt provides the following to handle data fetching within your application :
    - useFetch
    - useLazyFetch
    - useAsyncData
    

## useFetch()

1. useFetch by itself sends a get request 
2. we can also create a post request and send a body of data 

```vue 
<script setup>
// site with fake usernames and passwords
    const url = "https://regres,in/api/login"

// a form with username and password
    const form = reactive({
        email: "eve.holt@regres.in",
        password: "cityslicka",
    });

// a function that submits get request
    function onSubmit(){
        const response =useFetch(url)
    }
// modified function that submits post request of data
    function onSubmit(){
        const response =useFetch(url, {
            method: "post",
            body: form,
        })
    }
</script>
```

since the response from above is a pending request ( see promise)

we have to use await 
 
and the function to an async function

```vue

<script setup>
    async function onSubmit(){
        const response = await useFetch(url, {
            method: "post",
            body: form,
        })
    console.log(response);
    } 
</script>
```

if we check the response (console.log) we can see it has some data an error

therefore we can modify the function to 

```vue

<script setup>
    async function onSubmit(){
        const {data, error} = await useFetch(url, {
            method: "post",
            body: form,
        })
    console.log(data, error); // to see
    } 
</script>
```

instead of the data we can use data.value ( see js value ) to get the data value
