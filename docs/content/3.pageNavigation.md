# Page Navigation

1. we can use <NuxtLink> component to navigate between pages 
    - <NuxtLink> is an extension of the  router link from vue router
2. or we can use the navigateTo() utility method which allows for programmatic navigation 
3. pages must have a single root element to allow route transitions between pages - not a vue charecteristic
