# Dynamic Routes 

1. values placed inside square brackets will become dynamic routes 

2. file names can comprise of both dynamic and non dynamic text 

```vue 
-| pages/
---| index.vue
---| users-[group]/
-----| [id].vue

```

3. this is very useful for products

4. lets say we have a bunch of iphones with different names
    - iphone 1
    - iphone 2
    - iphone 3 

5. we would have to make pages for each iphone 
6. instead we can create a single page named `iphone-[name].vue` where number is dynamic route
7. inside the inside page we call it 

```Vue
<template>
    <p> This is the page for iphone-{{ $route.params.name }} </p>
</template>
```

```Vue
<template>
    <p> This is the page for iphone-{{ name }} </p>
</template>

<script setup>

const route = useRoute() ;

// replace hyphen with space
const name = computed(() => {
    return route.params.name.replaceAll("-", " ") ;
});

</script>

```
