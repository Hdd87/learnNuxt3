 <p>
    this is a sentence from the about.vue component inside pages directory <br />

    but I can still see the counter, and toggle button :(   <br />

    and the development must be restart to see any new changes in dev mode <br />

    http://localhost:3000/about to see this page <br />

    but if change the app.vue file's name to something else and restart dev  <br />

    I can only see the pages inside the pages directory
